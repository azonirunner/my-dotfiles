# My Dot Files

They're awesome right?  Just remember that everything I'm making here is completely opinionated.  The good news is this is the source, and you can change whatever you want!!

## Requirements

### MacOS:

- Xcode
- Brew
- MacOS

### Linux:

- Apt(probably will have it).
- Debian/Ubuntu
- Preferably git, but the initial scripts should get this.

I'm just starting with the menus in the bash script, these will improve.  I will implement more package managers hopefully in the future.  The VPS code is intended for an Ubuntu/Debian server.  I like to do a lot of my development from Digital Ocean Droplets so I can use a Chromebook for development.

Anyways.....make sure if you're using Linux to pick the vim package that corresponds to your Desktop Environment(DE).  This will let you keep those clipboards under control.  Big hint....Ubuntu is `vim-gtk`
